Port Scanner usage:
python3 pscan.py [ip] [port]

I had good intentions of adding more functionality but I got covid on Friday and haven't been able to do much. So the script is pretty basic, it sends a packet to the port with TCP and checks if the port is open or not. Then it writes the packets that were sent to a pdf called "packets.pdf".
